# Pintrecipes
This script scrapes your Pinterest board for recipes, finds all ingredients needed for recipes, then consolidates all ingredients together to give you one concise ingredient shopping list!


Finding recipes on Pinterest is fun! Flipping through 5 different web pages / tabs on your phone while grocery shopping however, is not. 

This script helps make that step a little bit easier by consolidated all ingredients needed so your grocery shopping trip is a little bit easier!

The next evolution/step of this project is to integrate it with Amazon fresh in order to autopopulate a cart and completely automate your grocery shopping experience for those lazier Sundays. Unfortunately, an Amazon Fresh API is open to very limited usage from my research, so this step will have to wait until further permissions are granted to the general public.
